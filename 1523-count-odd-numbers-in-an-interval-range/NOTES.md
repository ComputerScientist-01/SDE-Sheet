Approach: Total numbers in the range will be (R – L + 1) i.e. N.
If N is even then the count of both odd and even numbers will be N/2.
If N is odd,
If L or R is odd, then the count of odd number will be N/2 + 1 and even numbers = N – countofOdd.
Else, count of odd numbers will be N/2 and even numbers = N – countofOdd.
